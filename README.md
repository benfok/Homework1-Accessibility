Enhancing code to improve accessibility compliance and optimize for search engines

## Task
We have been hired by a marketing agency and asked to refactor some existing code to meet web accessibility best practices. We have been given specific criteria for this, and as a bonus we have an opportunity to improve the codebase.

## Project Work
My live website can be found [here](https://benfok.github.io/homework1-accessibility/)

My file repository in GitHub is [here](https://github.com/benfok/homework1-accessibility/)

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria 

```
It's done when the codebase uses semantic HTML elements
It's done when the HMTL elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
It's done when the images and icons contain accessible alt attributes
It's done when the heading attributes fall in sequential order
It's done when the site has a concise, descriptive title
```

## Proof
The end result should resemble the image below:

## Actions
I considered the following during this project:

- Aiming to replace all <div> tags within the codespace with more descriptive, semantic HTML tags
- Cleaning up the code through tag flow and indentation
- Ensuring all the code is solid and meets accessibility best practices (links working, alt text etc.)
- Consolidating the css code; removing redundant css classes and codes
- Ensuring the css code follows the HTML page structure
- I included a change-log.txt file with a chronological list of the changes I made
